Tom is working in a credit card processing company as a team leader.\\nHis team is responsible to validate certain data for new credit card applications. \\nThe time spent by his team on an application is normally distributed with average 300 minutes and standard deviation 40 minutes.\\nTom and his team worked on process improvement to reduce the time spent in processing new applications.\\nAfter implementing the improvements, Tom checked the time spent by his team on randomly selected 25 new card applications.\\nThe average time spent is 290 min. Tom is happy that, though it is a small improvement, it is a step in right direction. \\nHe shares the good news with his manager Lisa.\\nBut Lisa in not convinced about the improvement. At 95% confidence, is the processes really improved?'"
